</div>
Decisional impairments in people with dementia have been well studied, but the 
role of caregivers as decision-makers remains underexplored, despite growing 
attention in recent research. Many caregivers are insufficiently prepared and 
supported to make the difficult decisions associated with their role, which 
contributes to caregiver burden and leads to negative outcomes for both the 
caregiver and care recipient. Research is needed to understand how decisions 
made for other people differ from decisions made for oneself, both in the 
context of a longstanding caregiving relationship and also when relatives or 
friends are unexpectedly called upon to make decisions for an older adult.

Our study will compare three groups: (1) dementia caregivers, (2) healthy older 
adults, and (3) a matched cohort of non-caregiving healthy adults who are 
relatives/friends of healthy older adults in group (2). All participants will 
use a secure web-enabled platform at home to make hypothetical and real 
(incentivized) decisions for themselves. Participants in groups (1) and (3) will 
also make decisions on behalf of their respective study partners—group (1) for a 
care recipient with dementia, and group (3) for a healthy older adult in group (2).

</div>

Decision-making presents special challenges for people with dementia and their 
caregivers. Whereas advance care planning has historically focused on 
high-acuity interventions at the end of life, key decisions in dementia often 
unfold over many years of impaired capacity and focus less on life prolongation 
than on personal care decisions, such as where to live or budgeting for 
out-of-pocket costs. Furthermore, in the course of dementia individuals often 
express care preferences that conflict with previous planning documents or 
earlier discussions, which poses crucial ethical challenges for caregivers and 
clinicians in deciding whether to honor the wishes expressed previously by a 
patient when still competent or instead to honor the wishes of the person as 
they are now. Such challenges may contribute to burden, diminished closeness, 
and poor health outcomes in people with dementia and their caregivers. New 
frameworks are needed to help caregivers cope with perceived changes in 
previously shared values; and to inform the critical task of helping care 
recipients make decisions congruent with their values. 

In this multidisciplinary collaboration involving philosophy, neurology, social 
science, and psychology, we will interview people with Alzheimer's disease and 
frontotemporal dementia, with their caregivers, at three timepoints over three 
years to document experiences and patterns of change in the course of illness. 
Topics will include the narrative self-understanding of people with dementia 
regarding changes in themselves, and caregivers' responses and adaptations to 
changes in care recipients.

</div>

Emerging neurotechnologies hold immense potential for advancing medical 
treatments, but if their design and implementation do not prioritize the goals, 
needs, and insights of the patients who use them, they risk becoming a source of 
harm. Many neurotechnologies are being designed for intended use by people with 
sensory or motor disabilities, but if the teams building these treatments do not 
include people with disabilities, there is a risk that the lived experiences and 
perspectives of intended users may not be appropriately integrated. In past 
efforts to develop neurotechnology, technical achievements have sometimes been 
prioritized over practical benefit, resulting in poor outcomes. 

This project aims to facilitate the development of effective and ethically sound 
therapies for nervous system conditions, focusing on how novel devices can be 
best designed for the benefit of users. In one branch of research, we are 
interviewing a group of pioneer neurotechnology recipients to document their 
experiences with how their devices are integrated into their lives. In another 
branch, we are interviewing experts involved in neurotechnology development to 
assess perspectives and current barriers to incorporating user perspectives in 
neurotechnology design.

</div>
Patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are prone to making bad decisions; unfortunately, FTD is often only diagnosed after patients have made significant errors. Such delays reflect the absence of objective clinical tests for decision-making, and represent missed opportunities to prevent serious harms. 

We are studying decision-making in familial FTD kindreds from two large NIH-funded multicenter networks spanning the US and Canada. We hypothesize that early behavioral and physiological changes in FTD mutation carriers will reveal initial signs and mechanisms of impaired judgment in FTD, potentially also elucidating neural mechanisms of impaired decision-making in other neuropsychiatric disorders. Presymptomatic mutation carriers and noncarrier family members from these multicenter networks are recruited to perform tests of decision-making on a secure web-enabled platform that enables rapid and flexible data collection from participants across North America. Linking our behavioral measures to a rich dataset of cognitive and neuroimaging measures already being collected across network sites allows us to combine the strengths of traditional on-site evaluation with the flexibility and scaling advantages of newer online methods.

</div>
New technologies that modulate brain function have tremendous potential for alleviating the burden of neuropsychiatric illness, but raise challenging ethical and societal questions. The President’s Bioethics Commission and other experts have called for the integration of ethics and neuroscience, which will require collaboration across humanistic and scientific disciplines as well as the engagement of patients and researchers at the forefront of novel neurotechnologies. 

To address these issues, we have built a cohesive interdisciplinary team with expertise in neuroscience, clinical care, law, philosophy and social science. Our work focuses on the development of implantable “closed-loop” devices that can both monitor and adaptively modify brain systems involved in mood and behavior regulation. We are observing and interviewing patients undergoing novel closed-loop interventions for epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and mood disorders, along with their family members. We are also studying how their experiences and concerns can be incorporated in clinicians’ and researchers’ views about the ethical development of neurotechnology.

  <div class="project-title" style="color: #f26d04">Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias</div>
</div>
Decisional impairments in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias can have disastrous consequences for patients and their families. While recent research in decision neuroscience and neuroeconomics holds great promise for elucidating neural mechanisms underlying these impairments, in many cases it remains unclear how neuroscientific findings can be applied to the decision-making errors that patients exhibit in real life. 

We address this gap by linking current decision neuroscience to clinical standards routinely applied in the assessment of patients’ decision-making abilities. On a widely-accepted standard, impaired decisions in dementia and other cognitive disorders can result from failures to: (1) understand relevant features of a decision, (2) appreciate how this relates to one’s own situation, (3) rationally manipulate information to arrive at a decision, or (4) consistently evidence a choice. These criteria reflect clinicians’ expertise with patients’ impairments and embody mechanistic assumptions about how decision-making is compromised in disease--assumptions that can now be investigated empirically. 

Our work links these accepted clinical standards to current constructs in decision neuroscience, utilizing task-based functional MRI and computational modeling of decision-making in well-characterized cohorts of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, patients with frontotemporal dementia, and healthy older controls, all with linked clinical and neuroimaging data. We aim to advance our understanding of mechanisms of clinical decision-making impairments, ultimately resulting in improved assessment tools and in targets for future interventions to prevent serious harms to patients.

</div>

Traditionally, research subjects undergo behavioral testing and other data collection during on-site evaluations in dedicated research laboratories. While this allows for detailed cognitive, clinical and neuroimaging characterization of each subject, the labor and time costs associated with sequential on-site subject evaluation often place severe constraints on sample size and flexibility. Some researchers have addressed these limitations by using online panels to administer behavioral tasks to large numbers of subjects at home. This approach is highly flexible and scalable, but cannot evaluate hypotheses that require neuroimaging or standardized cognitive measurements.

Our research program combines the detailed subject characterization enabled by on-site evaluation with the flexibility and scaling advantages of online testing. Participants in this project (currently ~140 neurologically normal adults ages 65-95) undergo extensive in-person cognitive testing and neuroimaging through the [UCSF Healthy Aging Study](https://memory.ucsf.edu/healthy-aging-study){:target="\_blank"} and [Normal Aging and Cognitive Decline Study](https://memory.ucsf.edu/normal-aging-and-cognitive-decline){:target="\_blank"}. These investigations are linked to behavioral data collected on secure, web-enabled platform allowing these subjects to complete study tasks at home.
