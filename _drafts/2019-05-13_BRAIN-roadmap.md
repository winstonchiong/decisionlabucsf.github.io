The NIH BRAIN Initiative [Neuroethics Roadmap](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-group/neuroethics-roadmap){:target="_blank"},
released by the Neuroethics Subgroup of the Advisory Committee to the Director Working Group, served as the topic of this neuroethics seminar
led by Winston Chiong. After our discussion, which largely focused on Chapter 6, “Integrating Neuroethics and Neuroscience,” participants 
of this session composed a public comment in response to the Roadmap. 

The Roadmap calls for the expansion of the neuroethics arm of BRAIN 2.0, with specific recommendations including a compulsory neuroethics 
section on all BRAIN Initiative grant applications and a notable budget increase from 1.8% to 5% of the BRAIN Initiative’s total 
annual funds. Like the Roadmap’s authors, we reflected on outcomes of the Human Genome Project’s Ethical, Legal and Social Implications 
(ELSI) group in envisioning the role of the BRAIN Initiative within the field of neuroethics. We expressed interest in fostering a 
dedicated neuroethics workforce that includes neuroscientists with firsthand knowledge of medical applications, as well as junior 
researchers with the potential to commit to long-term neuroethics pursuits. Also of great concern was myopia within neuroethics research 
questions and the squandering of scientific creativity through funding restrictions, which could create intellectual blind spots and 
leave neuroethicists unprepared to address other important issues as they arise. We shared our thoughts on effective use of BRAIN 
neuroethics funds as well as a need for additional funding sources beyond NIH to support the investigation of neuroethics research 
questions unrelated to health, such as the legal and social implications of neuroscientific advances. Finally, we discussed the potential
for neuroethics Centers of Excellence to perform community engagement and enhance public attitudes toward neuroscience.
