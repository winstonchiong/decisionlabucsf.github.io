[Maya Katz](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/maya.katz){:target="\_blank"}, Assistant Professor of Neurology at the UCSF Movement Disorders
and Neuromodulation Center, led a works-in-progress session on her research about the Parkinson’s disease (PD) “mortality myth” and 
the benefits of incorporating palliative care into PD management. Joined by social workers, neurologists, and palliative care specialists, 
we voiced our perspectives on misconceptions about PD mortality and best practices for end-of-life conversations. 


The PD “mortality myth” refers to the misleading, yet ubiquitous characterization of PD as a chronic disease that does not effect life
expectancy, rather than as a terminal, neurodegenerative illness. We recognized the unfortunate perpetuation of this myth within cultural 
and clinical settings alike, criticizing inaccurate news media coverage and inadequate end-of-life planning for PD patients. Upon
examining cause-of-death statistics, we discovered that PD side-effects, such as aspiration pneumonia and sudden falls,
account for the majority of PD cases instead of the disease itself. These reports ignited conversation about the myth's 
positive-feedback-loop quality, its influence on the production of information that further supports its validity. Informed by anecdotes
of frustrated caregivers and the disproportionately high rate of PD hospital deaths, we advocated for palliative care strategies as a
means of reducing caregiver burden and improving patient quality of life. Additionally, we called for a patient-centered approach to
diagnosis delivery, as well as ongoing conversations about prognosis that address disease heterogeneity, cognitive decline, and potential
comorbidities.
