Today’s seminar was led by Toby Haeusermann and Celeste Fong, discussing a recent review they wrote with fellow Decision Lab member, 
Cailin Lechner, on the book The Origins of Bioethics: Remembering When Medicine Went Wrong by John A. Lynch. They presented an overview 
of the three case studies included in the book (the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the Willowbrook Hepatitus Study, and the Cincinnati Whole 
Body Radiation Study), followed by a summary of how, and why, the author depicted public remembrance of the events as either minimal 
remembrance or meaningful forgetting. 

The primary criticism of the book is that it is less about the history of bioethics as a field as much as it is an analysis of how 
bioethics events are presented to the public to foster remembrance (or perhaps, forgetting). As such, the discussion gravitated towards 
how institutions and the public could best present bioethics cases honestly, with an accepting of responsibility and duty to improve 
without instilling fear or mistrust in the community.
