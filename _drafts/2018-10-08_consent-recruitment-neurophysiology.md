Joncarmen (JC) Mergenthaler led a works-in-progress seminar about his current investigation into consent and recruitment within 
intracranial electrophysiology studies, which require utilization of patients with preexisting cause for neurosurgical treatment, 
such as epilepsy or Parkinson’s disease. Tacking research onto neurosurgery introduces an array of ethical concerns, from increased 
time on the operating table to conflict of interest to therapeutic misconception. JC presented preliminary findings from 11 of 26 
semi-structured interviews with members of neurophysiology research teams, and our group discussed common themes, including 
standardization, consent processes, unique risks, and vulnerability.


The initial evidence reveals diversity in *who* introduces the study to the patient, *who* obtains consent, and *when* consent is 
obtained. We weighed the benefits and detriments of having a neurosurgeon act as the consenting team member, for instance, the 
advantage of providing expert knowledge to patients versus the risk of conflating clinical treatment with research practice. We also 
explored possible explanations for the widespread perception among PIs that their research protocol aligns with that of similar 
studies despite inter-study inconsistencies revealed by the data. When discussing efforts to prevent enrollment of “desperate” or 
misinformed patients, we questioned the methods by which these studies assess patients’ capacity to consent and comprehension of 
research-specific risks. We contemplated the use of third-party consent monitors as well as the limits of online survey tools for 
evaluating capacity.
