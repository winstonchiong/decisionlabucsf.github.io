Just in between two of our Northern California "atmospheric river" storm systems, 
we lucked out with beautiful weather for our fall BBQ. This year, we got to meet 
new lab member and epilepsy fellow [Lara](/team/index.html#Lara-Kolawole). And 
while they've been in the lab a while now and it wasn't really an introduction, 
this was the first BBQ for [Juliana](/team/index.html#Juliana-Friend), 
[Carleigh](/team/index.html#Carleigh-Williams), 
[Jaaie](/team/index.html#Jaaie-Varshney), 
[Chanel](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu/people/chanel-matney), and 
[Ignacia](/team/index.html#Ignacia-Arteaga). Furthermore, it was great to have lab alum 
[Noah](/team/index.html#Noah-Cryns) to give an update on his training in 
geropsychology.

One highlight of this year's BBQ was that we had three dog guests - Winnie, 
Watson, and Ren - joining Jordy and Doc. (We did miss Yuzu, who made it last 
year; and Mazelle, not her kind of party.) Watson and Jordy in particular spent 
a good part of the BBQ zooming around the yard together. At the end we tried to 
get the dogs to pose together for a group photo, though Ren preferred to hang 
back in his shy way:
