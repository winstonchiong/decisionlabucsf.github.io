Our biggest in-person gathering in over a year! We were able to see most of those leaving for their following chapters; although, as we've seen with previous alumni, we hopefully won't get much of a chance to miss them. [Sang](/team/index.html#Sang-Ngo) will be the first to leave us for UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, followed by [Cailin](/team/index.html#Cailin-Lechner), who's going off to UC Davis' School of Law. [Emily](/team/index.html#Emily-Hardy) will be traveling the furthest from us, returning to her home state's Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in Arizona. [Loren](/team/index.html#Loren-Gotingco) graduated from the University of San Francisco's nursing program and will be the last to leave this cycle upon entering the workforce. We're all so proud of what this group contributed during their time in the lab, and we know their future schools and employers are fortunate to have such bright, compassionate, and uniquely remarkable people joining them.
