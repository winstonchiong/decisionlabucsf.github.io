We were very pleased to help host the 
[UCSF Weill Neuroethics Symposium](https://weill.ucsf.edu/neuroethics-symposium){:target="\_blank"}, 
part of the Weill Neurosciences Symposium Series. Given the potential of new 
advances to change the lives of patients with neurologic and psychiatric illness, 
and even society at large, the symposium had two main aims: to better prepare 
the neurosciences community to anticipate and address neuroethical concerns 
arising from their work, and to prepare for broader public engagement with these 
issues. The program began with introductory remarks by 
[Stephen Hauser](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stephen.hauser){:target="\_blank"}, 
Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, sharing his vision for 
neuroethics in the UCSF Weill Institute and drawing upon his experience as a 
member of President Obama's Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical 
Issues. 

Our first panel, **Neurogenetics & Parenthood**, was anchored by a presentation 
by [Jennifer Doudna](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/jennifer-doudna){:target="\_blank"}, 
providing an introduction to CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and the potential 
implications of this technology for biomedicine and society. 
[Hank Greely](https://profiles.stanford.edu/henry-greely){:target="\_blank"} 
presented a brief yet comprehensive overview of potential domains of concern 
in advancing neuroscience: prediction, mind-reading, responsibility, 
treatment, enhancement, and ethical research. 
[Laurie Zoloth](https://provost.uchicago.edu/directory/laurie-zoloth){:target="\_blank"} 
then offered historical and humanistic insights cautioning that new technologies 
may alleviate but cannot eliminate the uncertainties of parenthood. 
[Stephan Sanders](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stephan.sanders){:target="\_blank"} 
joined these speakers in a wide-ranging discussion including scientists' 
responsibilities to society and anticipated dilemmas in first-in-human trials of 
upcoming neurogenetic therapies. 

Our second panel, **Neuromodulation Roundtable**, considered common ethical 
dilemmas in a range of new applications of neurotechnology to monitor and 
modulate brain function. 
[Jose Carmena](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/jose-m-carmena){:target="\_blank"} 
demonstrated exciting new approaches to sensing and stimulating the brain 
from an engineering and industry perspective. Meanwhile, patients/participants' 
perspectives were represented in 
[Katherine Scangos](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/katherine.scangos){:target="\_blank"}'s 
presentation, with observations from the first patient enrolled in a novel trial 
of closed-loop stimulation for treatment-resistant depression (whom we were 
honored to have in attendance). 
[Joseph Fins](http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-jjfins){:target="\_blank"} 
discussed decades of scholarship and self-examination regarding his team's use 
of deep brain stimulation to restore function in patients with disorders of 
consciousness. Finally, 
[Sara Goering](https://phil.washington.edu/people/sara-goering){:target="\_blank"} 
drew upon ideas from disability studies and her group's empirical 
research to argue that some conceptual worries about agency or self-ownership 
may be mitigated by adopting a more constructive conception of "co-agency" 
between neural devices and their users. 

After a lunch break featuring several smaller, informal conversations among our 
invited experts and UCSF/UC Berkeley trainees, 
[Eric Topol](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/topol/){:target="\_blank"} 
headlined our third panel, **Patient Data in the Digital Age**, with an 
alternately exhilarating and frightening presentation detailing the incredible 
reach of mobile computing and artificial intelligence into myriad facets of our 
daily lives and health. 
[Kate Rankin](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/katherine.rankin){:target="\_blank"} 
discussed pathways for bringing powerful analytic and visualization tools from 
the research setting back into the clinic to improve diagnosis and 
decision-making, though with potential ethical and policy concerns. 
[Anna Wexler](https://medicalethicshealthpolicy.med.upenn.edu/faculty-all/anna-wexler){:target="\_blank"} 
noted that while privacy and agency raise deep concerns, we should also be 
wary of commercial and other interests in exaggerating the power of currently 
available neural devices. 
[Gabe Aranovich](https://mindstronghealth.com/team/gabe-aranovich-md/){:target="\_blank"} 
offered observations from his work in private industry, including the attention 
paid to issues of privacy and confidentiality in digital health startups and 
challenges of ethical governance in institutions dedicated to 
maximizing shareholder value. 

In his closing remarks, 
[Sam Barondes](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/samuel.barondes){:target="\_blank"} 
recalled the 
[first neuroethics meeting in 2002](https://dana.org/article/neuroethics-mapping-the-field/){:target="\_blank"},
also held in San Francisco. 
(According to Zach Hall, the term "neuroethics" was coined by Bill Safire at the 
UCSF Mission Bay campus!) He noted with satisfaction both that neuroscientific 
tools and understanding have advanced considerably from the techniques discussed 
that day, and that the neuroethics community has matured and grown more 
sophisticated in addressing the implications of these changes.
