[Joncarmen Mergenthaler](/team/index.html#Joncarmen Mergenthaler)'s poster on consent and recruitment in human electrophysiology 
studies was voted Best Poster by the attendees of the [International Neuroethics Society 2018 meeting](https://www.neuroethicssociety.org/meeting-program){:target="_blank"}

electrophysiology research in patients undergoing neurosurgical interventions. Great work JC!
