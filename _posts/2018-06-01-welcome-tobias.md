We're very excited to welcome [Tobias Häusermann](/team/index.html#Tobias Häusermann) as our first neuroethics postdoc! Toby joins the lab from 
Switzerland by way of Cambridge University, where he wrote his PhD dissertation in sociology based on fieldwork
in Germany's first Dementia Village. Part of this work was recently published as ["Professionalised intimacy: how dementia care workers navigate between domestic intimacy and institutional detachment"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-9566.12730){:target="\_blank"} in *Sociology of Health and Illness*. Toby will be joining us at Mission Bay while also embedding in the Medical Cultures Lab with Dan Dohan at Laurel Heights. As part of our project on patient and researcher experiences with new implanted neurotechnologies, he will also be observing and interviewing patients at Parnassus and Mount Zion, and so by the end of his fellowship will surely also be our lab expert on the UCSF shuttle system!
