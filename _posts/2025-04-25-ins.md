We recently welcomed [Juliana](/team/index.html#Juliana-Friend) to Decision Lab 
and [Chanel](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu/people/chanel-matney) 
to [UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu), and then very soon 
afterwards traveled together to exchange ideas 
and hopefully initaite new collaborations with scholars from around the world 
at the International Neuroethics Society meeting in Munich. As other exciting 
news, we will co-host next year's 
[Neuroethics 2026](https://neuroethicssociety.org/meeting/neuroethics-2026/) 
meeting, which will be utilizing a new multi-hub global model with hubs in Palo 
Alto, Tuscany, and we hope a few other places. We are very excited about this 
new plan and look forward to providing more updates about this model soon.
