It's been a very long time coming, and honestly I wasn't sure what to mark as 
our date for welcoming [Clara Sanches](/team/index.html#Clara-Sanches) to the 
lab. Let's see--she first gave a presentation to our lab on her prior work back 
in March 2020, and we originally offered her a postdoc in April 2020 to begin 
September 2020. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic her embassy interview 
kept getting postponed, and honestly we started to worry about whether her visa 
would ever come through! With lots of wonderful help and flexibility from the 
UCSF International Students and Scholars Office and the Office for Postdoctoral 
Scholars, we were able to set up a remote-work position in December 2020 while 
waiting for her interview, and she was finally able to come to San Francisco in 
February 2021 (though, of course, we're all still working remotely).

Clara joins us from Portugal via the 
[ICM-Pitié Salpêtrière](https://institutducerveau-icm.org/en/){:target="\_blank"} 
in Paris (the 
birthplace of neurology), where she did her PhD and initial postdoc with Marc 
Teichmann and Antoni Valero-Cabre. She brings tremendous experience in working 
with patients with rare neurodegenerative conditions, including advanced research 
on noninvasive brain stimulation in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, 
behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and primary progressive aphasia. She 
has just published a 
[comprehensive review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33551785/){:target="\_blank"} 
of noninvasive brain stimulation in neurodegeneration informed by her work. 
Here at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center she'll be working on our 
[Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) and 
[Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias](/projects/index.html#dma), 
developing new skills in functional neuroimaging analysis. We are so glad to 
have her and grateful for her patience and perseverance!
