It's that time of year again! This send-off was a little more bitter than sweet because of physical distancing. Still, we couldn't be more excited to see what psychological insights [Heather](/team/index.html#Heather-Romero-Kornblum) will contribute to UCSD's Rady School of Management, and how Emory's School of Medicine will benefit having [Madhu's](/team/index.html#Madhu-Manivannan) caring intellect(we assume they'll probably have more compost bins). We're hoping to drag you to our virtual game nights on occasion, but that won't prevent us from missing everything you both bring to the lab.
