Summer in SF means that the Decision Lab is back at the ballpark for garlic 
fries and beautiful bay views. Though we've had a run of SF's infamous "June 
gloom" this month, the weather today was amazing and sunny. Also, while our 
Giants have honestly been a pretty boring team for the last few years and were 
expected to not do anything much this season, this year's team has turned out 
to be a pretty scrappy and exciting group right in the middle of the playoff 
chase. 

Today's matchup unexpectedly got even more spicy as Rafael Devers, previously 
maybe the best hitter on the Red Sox, got traded to the Giants the week before 
our game. During the game, we got to see him hit his first home run as a Giant, 
against his former team. This ranks up with seeing Eddie Rosario 
[hit for the cycle](https://sabr.org/journal/article/origin-of-the-phrase-hitting-for-the-cycle-and-an-approach-to-how-cycles-occur/)
as one of the cooler baseball moments we've gotten to see together at a 
ballgame, and of course this one was better because it was to the Giants' 
benefit. Someone proposed to his partner on the scoreboard, a pretty bold 
and romantic move (she said yes). 
And we got to see an exciting ending, coming down to the last out 
with the tying run at third base, which made for an excited and relieved crowd 
when the Giants pulled out the victory!
