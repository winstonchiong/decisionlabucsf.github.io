Sadly, it's that time of year again, though it's also exciting to see the next 
steps that our lab members are taking in their careers. We got together for some
tasty Burmese food on Noah's last day to celebrate, though unfortunately Chenyu
couldn't make it with some final program requirements. 

[Noah](/team/index.html#Noah-Cryns) joined the lab back in 2021, during the 
pandemic, and has been a great source of continuity and support for our newer
research coordinators--particularly through the transitions of the last year. 
[Manizhe](/team/index.html#Manizhe-Eslami-Amirabadi) has been a behavioral 
neurology fellow training at the Memory and Aging Center, also with an ethics 
project selected for the American Academy of Neurology's 
[NITCEE](https://www.aan.com/research/neurologist-in-training-clinical-ethics-elective)
(Neurologist-in-training Clinical Ethics Elective) program. And 
[Chenyu](/team/index.html#Chenyu-Wang) has been a great asset to the lab, coming 
to us as one of the first students in UCSF's new 
[Master's in Health Data Science](https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu/masters-degree-health-data-science) 
program and bringing his quantitative skills to some of our tricky data. So 
excited to see what you all do next!
