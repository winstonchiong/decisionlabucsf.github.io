I was pleased and proud to join the first-ever and possibly-last 
[UCSF School of Medicine Virtual Commencement Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJhcaQEVn8&feature=youtu.be){:target="\_blank"} 
to celebrate the pioneering class of 2020, 
especially Decision Lab alumni [Alex Beagle](team/index.html#Alex-Beagle), 
(the first Decision Lab research coordinator, prior to med school), 
[Julia Heunis](team/index.html#Julia-Heunis) (the first Care Ecosystem CTN, prior 
to med school), and [Neil Vaishnav](team/index.html#Neil-Vaishnav) (current 
Decision Lab advanced degree record-holder). While I think we all were sad not 
to be able to gather together, the ceremony was also the most meaningful I can 
remember. Every day we are now reminded of the importance of compassionate, 
evidence-informed and patient-centered care, and 
we know that Alex, Julia, Neil and their classmates will soon be doing some of 
the very most important work in the midst of this historic pandemic.
