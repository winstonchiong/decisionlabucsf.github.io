  description: I have several roles at UCSF, which (I hope) inform one another
               as each of them involves challenges in thinking about the brain 
               and important decisions that patients, caregivers, and clinicians 
               face. I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical 
               practice focuses on Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, 
               and other cognitive disorders of aging. I am also a **cognitive 
               neuroscientist**, applying observations from clinic to 
               investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad 
               decisions. Furthermore, I am a **neuroethicist**, working alongside 
               other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to address the 
               ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
               to altered brain function. 
               
               
               I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During 
               medical school here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in 
               philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek 
               Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did 
               a combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging 
               with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
               at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the 
               [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Director 
              of [UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              and a member of the the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. 
              Beyond UCSF, I serve on the 
              [Neuroethics Working Group](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through

  description:  Having lived for extended periods in Thailand, Japan, and the 
                United States, I gained insight into the diverse healthcare 
                practices and attitudes toward dementia and the disparate 
                resources for diagnosis, treatment and care across borders 
                and demographic groups. I want to use my background in health
                economics and the expertise I acquire at UCSF Memory and Aging
                Center to contribute to the advancement of brain health equity
                through enhanced public health programs that can provide global
                benefits.


                I earned my PhD in Health Economics from Hiroshima University
                and a master’s degree in Human Resource Development from Waseda
                University in Tokyo. My doctoral research in Dr. Yoshihiko 
                Kadoya’s lab focused on identifying key determinants that 
                exposed populations in different countries to increased health 
                risks thereby enabling timely intervention measures. 


                Joining Decision Lab under Dr. Winston Chiong is an exciting
                opportunity. I am currently working on a project aimed at 
                understanding how genetic predispositions to frontotemporal
                dementia influence decision-making in the pre-symptomatic phase.
                Through neuroeconomic methods, the research seeks to identify
                incidents of early impaired judgment that could lead to 
                intervention strategies to decelerate the onset of frontotemporal
                dementia.


                Outside of work, my interests include attending symphonic 
                concerts, visiting museums, keeping fit at the gym, kayaking,
                and exploring new places.

  description:   I have a longstanding interest in improving healthcare access
                  and equity in healthcare. After I finished each step of my medical
                  training in Iran, I worked in an underserved area of my country 
                  and learned about various cultures, dialects and languages as well 
                  as various belief systems. Moving to the US and living in Boston was
                  another exceptional experience. These experiences made me curious about 
                  the neurobiological basis of ethics as well as its cultural relevance. 
                  

                  Brain function was one of the most fascinating parts of medicine for 
                  me and while training in neurology, I realized that I am especially 
                  interested in cognitive function including language and behavior. Ethical 
                  aspects of dementia as a disease and observation of its burden on the 
                  patients and their caregivers have been also an important motivation
                  for me to pursue further training and research efforts in the field 
                  of neuroethics with hopes to help providing a more equitable care 
                  around the world by raising awareness about current disparities and
                  gaps in health literacy and healthcare access.


                  I love poetry, literature and music. They help me enjoy and make sense 
                  of our complex world. I spend my spare time with them, friends, family,
                  or nature! I also love art museums!

  description: I’m a sociocultural and medical anthropologist (PhD UC Berkeley) whose research examines 
               the relationships we form through and with the technologies we use. 
               My work demonstrates how these relationships are not only reflections of ethical considerations, 
               but are also active sites for addressing pressing ethical challenges. My research background focuses on 
               AI in mental health care and the use of generative AI tools in workplaces. 
               
               
               As an ethnographer for the Decision Lab, I apply qualitative research methods—such as interviews and participant 
               observation—to center the lived experiences of patients, caregivers, technologists, medical practitioners, 
               and other stakeholders in the Lab's array of research projects. I also draw on my background in disability studies 
               to explore more inclusive approaches to neuroethics. The principle of “Nothing about us without us” guides my work. 

               
               In my free time, I do things like question the notion of free time, go on walks with my small, loud Pomeranian, 
               and watch Netflix to the point where it asks, “Are you still watching?”

  description: I am a medical anthropologist specializing in community-engaged qualitative research. As a postdoctoral fellow at
               the Decision Lab, I conduct interviews to improve care and support for people with dementia and their care partners. 
               Prior to joining the Lab, I worked with Dr. Krista Harrison on research aiming to improve hospice and end-of-life 
               care for people with dementia. My work is guided by the belief that understanding the ethical frameworks of patients
               is crucial to promoting ethical and equitable healthcare. 


               Drawing on expertise in digital health, my work has also aimed to amplify the perspectives of diverse constituents
               on how to leverage the benefits of emerging technologies while minimizing potential harms. Currently, I seek to promote
               the meaningful involvement of patients in AI governance in collaboration with UCSF’s Bioethics and Regulatory Engagement
               (BRE) program. My upcoming work bridges interests in dementia and AI, examining the use of eldercare robots to mitigate
               loneliness. 


               I feel incredibly lucky that I get to talk with people about their lives for my job. In my free time I love baking cakes,
               dancing Cuban salsa, and hiking with my dog Mazelle.

  description:  I am a recent Loyola University Chicago graduate who majored in Neuroscience and minored in Bioethics. 


                My interest in Neuroethics began when I joined the Bioethics Bowl Team at Loyola University Chicago during my freshman year. 
                Each week, the team would meet to discuss various bioethical cases in preparation for a yearly tournament. 
                These meetings involved deep philosophical discussion, hours of research into various scientific and ethical concepts, 
                and collaboration with team members to answer moral questions pertaining to each bioethical case. 
                The cases we discussed ranged from the ethics of merging A.I. with the human brain 
                to the ethicality of using an artificial uterus to grow the next generation of the human race. 
                While I found nearly all the bioethical topics we discussed quite engaging, 
                the ethical dilemmas surrounding emerging neurotechnology and surrogate decision-making particularly piqued my interest.


                My eagerness to learn more about the ethics of neurotechnology and surrogate decision-making ultimately led me to the Decision Lab. 
                Dr. Chiong’s research on neurotechnology, Dementia, and decision-making aligns well with my research interests, 
                and I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to such important research. 


                In my spare time, I enjoy reading, collecting vintage books, thrifting, and playing video games.

  description: I am a recent graduate of Santa Clara University, where I 
              majored in Neuroscience with an emphasis on Applied Ethics. Early 
              in my academic career at SCU, I took a wide range of courses-- from 
              Western Philosophy and Informal Logic to Neuroethics. I became
              deeply interested in understanding the root of the "why" behind
              human behavior and thought. Neuroscience felt like the right
              path to satisfy my existing curiosities and promote further
              intellectual growth. I soon developed a strong interest in the 
              ethical considerations required to navigate the relationship 
              between technology and the brain. 


              Through various coursework, I explored the ethical and neurological 
              implications of emerging neurotechnologies. I became fascinated by 
              how these innovations can empower, complicate, and challenge our 
              approach to mental health, neurological disorders, and aging.


              During my final quarter, I worked with an older individual 
              experiencing memory impairments, administering psychological tests
              and managing clinical data. This hands-on experience was deeply 
              fulfilling and insightful. After graduation, I worked for a 
              longevity start-up, where I had the opportunity to create a 
              comprehensive framework for guiding ethical decision-making in 
              neuropsychological testing and treatment. These back-to-back
              experiences reinforced my commitment to understanding the 
              nuances of technology in healthcare and clinical practice with 
              empathy.

              
              I am grateful for this opportunity to broaden my learning and expand
              my research experience. 

             
              In my spare time, I enjoy yoga, photography, and hiking.
