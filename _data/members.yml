  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one 
               another. I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical 
               practice focuses on Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, 
               and other cognitive disorders of aging. I am also a **cognitive 
               neuroscientist**, applying observations from clinic to 
               investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad 
               decisions. Third, I am a **neuroethicist**, working alongside 
               other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to address the 
               ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
               to altered brain function. 
               
               
               I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During 
               medical school here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in 
               philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek 
               Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did 
               a combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging 
               with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
               at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the 
               [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Interim Director 
              of [UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"},

               I received my PhD and Master of Philosophy degrees in sociology 
               from the University of Cambridge, where I remain an 
               [Affiliated Researcher](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/dr-tobias-haeusermann){:target="\_blank"}.

               and was a member of its Long-term Care and Dementia group. I then 
               conducted postdoctoral research at the

               I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care 
               practices are interpreted differently in distinct cultural 
               settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am also 
               interested in aging studies, the sociology of health and illness, 
               comparative ethnographic research, and qualitative research 
               methodologies.

  description:  Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and 
                altered as needed. There are external movements, those that make 
                us act on objects and internal movements, an energy that we use 
                in space and time. 
                My interest in the body as a ‘depository of human 
                expressiveness’ led me to a degree in Psychomotor Therapy with a 
                Master’s specialization in old age and mental health (University 
                of Lisbon). An enriching experience with an aging population 
                triggered my interest in old age, 
                and I realized how much I still had to learn about the 
                biological and physiological mechanisms of aging and the 
                disruptions that lead to age-related diseases. 
  
  
                My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with 
                specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie 
                Curie University, Paris), provided me with the basis for 
                understanding brain aging mechanisms. 
                My enthusiasm in this domain propelled me to pursue a PhD in 
                Cognitive Neurosciences (Sorbonne University) at the Paris Brain 
                Institute, working in the field of language in neurodegenerative 
                diseases and the use of transcranial stimulation as a possible 
                therapeutic approach. 
                As movements, each word also has a biography that is related to 
                the biography of the person using it. Understanding how one’s 
                language abilities are affected during a disease process is 
                another piece in the complex domain of neurodegeneration and its 
                consequences on one’s identity.


                I am interested in understanding how an individual responds to 
                aging in different spheres of life and how the identification of 
                altered mechanisms in pathological aging can help prevent early 
                cognitive and functional decline. 
                By joining the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am 
                excited to explore how the process of decision-making is 
                affected and which are the neural basis that subtends 
                decision-making alterations.

  description: I am a behavioral neurology fellow at the Memory and Aging Center 
               and joined the Decision Lab to better understand decision making, 
               and ultimately help patients with cognitive or behavioral 
               impairments better navigate our complex world. 
 
 
               As an undergraduate studying economics at the University of 
               Michigan it was fascinating and terrifying to learn that the 
               overwhelming
               majority of economic theory, used to govern policy decisions 
               large and small, assumed all humans behaved perfectly rationally 
               at all 
               times (Homo economicus). While the burgeoning field of behavioral 
               economics is appropriately challenging these long-held beliefs, 
               the underlying neural mechanisms governing complex decision 
               making remain relatively elusive – though they can clearly be 
               observed to
               break down in patients suffering from neurological and 
               psychiatric illness. Neurologists frequently observe aging 
               patients with 
               cognitive impairment to be more susceptible to financial scams, 
               in extreme cases leading to complete financial catastrophe. 
               I am excited to join the Decision Lab to further our understanding 
               of the neural basis of complex decision making, including 
               financial decision making, and hopefully find ways to better 
               monitor at risk patients and intervene before they make potentially 
               devastating mistakes. 
 
 
               Between my time at the University of Michigan and joining the 
               MAC, I attended medical school at Case Western Reserve University
               and completed residency at the University of Colorado in Denver. 
               In my free time I enjoy reading, running, playing the guitar, 
               and more recently am trying to decide whether to forgive the 
               Giants for sweeping my Tigers in 2012, or just root for the As.

  description:  The Decision Lab is the perfect home for my interdisciplinary 
                interests. I received my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience at 
                the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where I conducted 
                research on Alzheimer’s disease. While there I also took several 
                philosophy courses, which introduced me to the field of bioethics. 
                I became so enamored with the subject that I went to study for a 
                Master’s in Bioethics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. I 
                had the opportunity to conduct work with a lab studying deep 
                brain stimulation as a potential therapy for treatment resistant 
                depression. 
                My thesis project analyzed patient perspectives to respond to 
                the ethical concerns and implications of DBS for depression, 
                particularly as it relates to themes of identity.
                
                
                My experience in neuroethics and neurotechnology led me to San 
                Francisco and UCSF, where I work as a research coordinator in 
                the Decision Lab for the 
                [Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies](/projects/index.html#neurotech) 
                study. 
                The project involves observing and interviewing patients, 
                caregivers, and providers in order to identify and respond to 
                concerns regarding the ethics of closed-loop deep brain 
                stimulation. I see value in the perspectives that these 
                narratives can provide as we develop best practices for novel 
                neurotechnologies. 
                More broadly, however, I am also curious as to how such 
                advancements in therapeutic technologies can challenge our 
                society’s perception of itself and its values. Beyond this 
                project, I also organize the [Neuroethics Seminar](/seminar/), 
                a twice-monthly interdisciplinary discussion on ethics-related 
                questions that arise from neuroscience research and clinical 
                neurology practice. 
                
                
                In my free time, I enjoy keeping up to date with the newest 
                films and shows, trying to find the best bites in San Francisco, 
                and pretending that I am half as good at rock climbing as the 
                rest of the SF population.

               I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Performing Arts Degree in the 
               Liberal Education for Arts Professionals program at Saint Mary’s 
               College of California. I am also earning an

               being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and the Alpha 
               Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
  
  
               While focusing on my artistry as a ballerina, I enjoyed traveling 
               the world and experiencing unique cultures. In my dance career, 
               I was awarded the Princess Grace Award, a Congressional Black 
               Caucus Foundation’s Performing Arts Medal, and the Chris Hellman 
               Award, among other newspaper and magazine features.
               While I appreciate and value my time in the dance world, I always 
               knew that I would like to go into medicine one day. 
 
 
               I discovered my passion for research during my time as an NIH 
               researcher in the Bridges to Baccalaureate Program through SF 
               State University. In this program, I acquired laboratory skills 
               and presented on various research projects. I enjoy volunteering 
               at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and at Shanti 
               Project, where I was grateful to be named the Spotlight Volunteer 
               in Shanti’s Spring 2019 Newsletter. I am thrilled to provide 
               emotional support and practical assistance for both children in 
               the hospital and assisting aging adults with disabilities in 
               Shanti.
 
 
               Compassion for our elderly with dementia is a value that is 
               essential in society, so I am incredibly interested in 
               researching and assisting with projects that enhance their 
               quality of life. This is one of many reasons I believe in and 
               value the research at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and why 
               I’m 
               excited about the work that I am doing as a member of the 
               Decision lab, specifically on the 
               [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) Project. 
               The insightful knowledge, experience, and abilities I will learn 
               while working at UCSF’s world-class facility will better prepare 
               me for my future as a physician and researcher.
 
 
               In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, reading, and Pilates.

                minored in Public Policy.
  
  
                At Berkeley, I was a psychology peer advisor, marketing research 
                ntern, research assistant, and library circulation assistant. 
                These positions allowed me to meet and assist many people from 
                diverse backgrounds, and I’m excited to continue this practice 
                at the Decision Lab and UCSF Memory and Aging Center.
                
                
                My research interest sparked when I became a research assistant 
                at the Berkeley Social Interaction Lab, where I researched awe 
                and psychophysiology. 
                I loved working with participants, brainstorming new techniques, 
                and analyzing the results. My time in this lab has taught me 
                valuable lifelong skills and has reiterated that I want to 
                impact and help others through research.
                
                
                After taking coursework in Clinical Psychology and 
                Neuropsychology, I was eager to learn more about mental and 
                aging disorders, which ultimately led me to the Decision Lab.
                Studying case studies of patients with dementia emphasized how 
                much is still unknown. The complexity and debilitating effects 
                of aging disorders have motivated me to work with this clinical 
                population. 
                I am grateful to be a part of the Decision Lab, where I have the 
                opportunity to discover unanswered questions about dementia and 
                fundamentally improve care for patients from all backgrounds.
               
               
                I enjoy playing basketball, playing video games, hiking, and 
                watching anime in my free time.

  description:  As an undergraduate, I attended UC Berkeley, where I developed a 
                fascination for the brain and behavior, prompting me to pursue a 
                degree in neurobiology. At Berkeley, I studied in the lab of Dr. 
                Linda Wilbrecht where I completed an honors thesis investigating 
                adolescent exploration, risk-taking, and reward-seeking 
                behaviors and their neurophysiological correlates. 
                During this time, I developed a passion for research, 
                particularly reward processing and decision making, and how the 
                dysfunction of these processes is relevant to disease and 
                addiction.


                Experiences outside of academics have been instrumental in 
                helping to refine my interests. For example, I work as a crisis 
                counselor, assisting folks in getting through challenging 
                moments in their lives. I also volunteered at the Alzheimer’s 
                Services of the East Bay. I found interacting with and working 
                to improve the quality of life for older individuals of all 
                backgrounds to 
                be critical and fulfilling, and I resolved to fuse this 
                meaningful work with my passion for research. I became 
                particularly interested in studying dementia, as this topic is 
                personal to me, and there is still so much to understand about 
                different dementias.


                I am extremely excited to be working as a clinical research 
                coordinator in both the Decision Lab and the lab of Dr. David 
                Perry. The research conducted by these groups integrates my 
                nterests in decision making, reward processing, and 
                neurodegenerative disease and allows me to contribute to 
                research that will improve the diagnostic accuracy of dementia 
                and allow for effective 
                treatment. I look forward to learning more about this complex 
                disease and hope our work can help patients and their loved ones 
                to cope with its often debilitating effects.  


                In my spare time, I enjoy surfing, playing basketball, playing 
                soccer, running and music.
