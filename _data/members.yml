  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one 
               another. I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical 
               practice focuses on Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, 
               and other cognitive disorders of aging. I am also a **cognitive 
               neuroscientist**, applying observations from clinic to 
               investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad 
               decisions. Third, I am a **neuroethicist**, working alongside 
               other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to address the 
               ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
               to altered brain function. 
               
               
               I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During 
               medical school here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in 
               philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek 
               Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did 
               a combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging 
               with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
               at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the 
               [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Director 
              of [UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              and a member of the the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. 
              Beyond UCSF, I serve on the 
              [Neuroethics Working Group](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through 
              Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Multi-Council Working 
              Group, the American Academy of Neurology's

  description:  Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and 
                altered as needed. There are external movements, those that make 
                us act on objects and internal movements, an energy that we use 
                in space and time. 
                My interest in the body as a ‘depository of human 
                expressiveness’ led me to a degree in Psychomotor Therapy with a 
                Master’s specialization in old age and mental health (University 
                of Lisbon). An enriching experience with an aging population 
                triggered my interest in old age, 
                and I realized how much I still had to learn about the 
                biological and physiological mechanisms of aging and the 
                disruptions that lead to age-related diseases. 
  
  
                My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with 
                specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie 
                Curie University, Paris), provided me with the basis for 
                understanding brain aging mechanisms. 
                My enthusiasm in this domain propelled me to pursue a PhD in 
                Cognitive Neurosciences (Sorbonne University) at the Paris Brain 
                Institute, working in the field of language in neurodegenerative 
                diseases and the use of transcranial stimulation as a possible 
                therapeutic approach. 
                As movements, each word also has a biography that is related to 
                the biography of the person using it. Understanding how one’s 
                language abilities are affected during a disease process is 
                another piece in the complex domain of neurodegeneration and its 
                consequences on one’s identity.


                I am interested in understanding how an individual responds to 
                aging in different spheres of life and how the identification of 
                altered mechanisms in pathological aging can help prevent early 
                cognitive and functional decline. 
                By joining the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am 
                excited to explore how the process of decision-making is 
                affected and which are the neural basis that subtends 
                decision-making alterations.

  description:  Having lived for extended periods in Thailand, Japan, and the 
                United States, I gained insight into the diverse healthcare 
                practices and attitudes toward dementia and the disparate 
                resources for diagnosis, treatment and care across borders 
                and demographic groups. I want to use my background in health
                economics and the expertise I acquire at UCSF Memory and Aging
                Center to contribute to the advancement of brain health equity
                through enhanced public health programs that can provide global
                benefits.


                I earned my PhD in Health Economics from Hiroshima University
                and a master’s degree in Human Resource Development from Waseda
                University in Tokyo. My doctoral research in Dr. Yoshihiko 
                Kadoya’s lab focused on identifying key determinants that 
                exposed populations in different countries to increased health 
                risks thereby enabling timely intervention measures. 


                Joining Decision Lab under Dr. Winston Chiong is an exciting
                opportunity. I am currently working on a project aimed at 
                understanding how genetic predispositions to frontotemporal
                dementia influence decision-making in the pre-symptomatic phase.
                Through neuroeconomic methods, the research seeks to identify
                incidents of early impaired judgment that could lead to 
                intervention strategies to decelerate the onset of frontotemporal
                dementia.


                Outside of work, my interests include attending symphonic 
                concerts, visiting museums, keeping fit at the gym, kayaking,
                and exploring new places.

  description:   I have a longstanding interest in improving healthcare access
                  and equity in healthcare. After I finished each step of my medical
                  training in Iran, I worked in an underserved area of my country 
                  and learned about various cultures, dialects and languages as well 
                  as various belief systems. Moving to the US and living in Boston was
                  another exceptional experience. These experiences made me curious about 
                  the neurobiological basis of ethics as well as its cultural relevance. 
                  

                  Brain function was one of the most fascinating parts of medicine for 
                  me and while training in neurology, I realized that I am especially 
                  interested in cognitive function including language and behavior. Ethical 
                  aspects of dementia as a disease and observation of its burden on the 
                  patients and their caregivers have been also an important motivation
                  for me to pursue further training and research efforts in the field 
                  of neuroethics with hopes to help providing a more equitable care 
                  around the world by raising awareness about current disparities and
                  gaps in health literacy and healthcare access.


                  I love poetry, literature and music. They help me enjoy and make sense 
                  of our complex world. I spend my spare time with them, friends, family,
                  or nature! I also love art museums!

  description:  I am a recent Loyola University Chicago graduate who majored in Neuroscience and minored in Bioethics. 


                My interest in Neuroethics began when I joined the Bioethics Bowl Team at Loyola University Chicago during my freshman year. 
                Each week, the team would meet to discuss various bioethical cases in preparation for a yearly tournament. 
                These meetings involved deep philosophical discussion, hours of research into various scientific and ethical concepts, 
                and collaboration with team members to answer moral questions pertaining to each bioethical case. 
                The cases we discussed ranged from the ethics of merging A.I. with the human brain 
                to the ethicality of using an artificial uterus to grow the next generation of the human race. 
                While I found nearly all the bioethical topics we discussed quite engaging, 
                the ethical dilemmas surrounding emerging neurotechnology and surrogate decision-making particularly piqued my interest.


                My eagerness to learn more about the ethics of neurotechnology and surrogate decision-making ultimately led me to the Decision Lab. 
                Dr. Chiong’s research on neurotechnology, Dementia, and decision-making aligns well with my research interests, 
                and I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to such important research. 


                In my spare time, I enjoy reading, collecting vintage books, thrifting, and playing video games.

  description:  As an undergraduate, I attended UC Berkeley, where I developed a 
                fascination for the brain and behavior, prompting me to pursue a 
                degree in neurobiology. At Berkeley, I studied in the lab of Dr. 
                Linda Wilbrecht where I completed an honors thesis investigating 
                adolescent exploration, risk-taking, and reward-seeking 
                behaviors and their neurophysiological correlates. 
                During this time, I developed a passion for research, 
                particularly reward processing and decision making, and how the 
                dysfunction of these processes is relevant to disease and 
                addiction.


                Experiences outside of academics have been instrumental in 
                helping to refine my interests. For example, I work as a crisis 
                counselor, assisting folks in getting through challenging 
                moments in their lives. I also volunteered at the Alzheimer’s 
                Services of the East Bay. I found interacting with and working 
                to improve the quality of life for older individuals of all 
                backgrounds to 
                be critical and fulfilling, and I resolved to fuse this 
                meaningful work with my passion for research. I became 
                particularly interested in studying dementia, as this topic is 
                personal to me, and there is still so much to understand about 
                different dementias.


                I am extremely excited to be working as a clinical research 
                coordinator in both the Decision Lab and the lab of Dr. David 
                Perry. The research conducted by these groups integrates my 
                nterests in decision making, reward processing, and 
                neurodegenerative disease and allows me to contribute to 
                research that will improve the diagnostic accuracy of dementia 
                and allow for effective 
                treatment. I look forward to learning more about this complex 
                disease and hope our work can help patients and their loved ones 
                to cope with its often debilitating effects.  
                In my spare time, I enjoy surfing, playing basketball, playing 
                soccer, running and music.

  description: I am transitioning from a former career as a Ballet dancer to a 
               field of medicine, science, and groundbreaking clinical research. 
               I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Performing Arts Degree in the 
               Liberal Education for Arts Professionals program at Saint Mary’s 
               College of California. I am also earning an
               Associate’s degree in the field of Biological Sciences at Canada 
               College. Among several extracurricular activities, I also enjoyed 
               being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and the Alpha 
               Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
  
  
               While focusing on my artistry as a ballerina, I enjoyed traveling 
               the world and experiencing unique cultures. In my dance career, 
               I was awarded the Princess Grace Award, a Congressional Black 
               Caucus Foundation’s Performing Arts Medal, and the Chris Hellman 
               Award, among other newspaper and magazine features.
               While I appreciate and value my time in the dance world, I always 
               knew that I would like to go into medicine one day. 
 
 
               I discovered my passion for research during my time as an NIH 
               researcher in the Bridges to Baccalaureate Program through SF 
               State University. In this program, I acquired laboratory skills 
               and presented on various research projects. I enjoy volunteering 
               at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and at Shanti 
               Project, where I was grateful to be named the Spotlight Volunteer 
               in Shanti’s Spring 2019 Newsletter. I am thrilled to provide 
               emotional support and practical assistance for both children in 
               the hospital and assisting aging adults with disabilities in 
               Shanti.
 
 
               Compassion for our elderly with dementia is a value that is 
               essential in society, so I am incredibly interested in 
               researching and assisting with projects that enhance their 
               quality of life. This is one of many reasons I believe in and 
               value the research at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and why 
               I’m 
               excited about the work that I am doing as a member of the 
               Decision lab, specifically on the 
               [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) Project. 
               The insightful knowledge, experience, and abilities I will learn 
               while working at UCSF’s world-class facility will better prepare 
               me for my future as a physician and researcher.
 
 
               In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, reading, and Pilates.
