  description: I am a medical student at the University of Califonria, San Francisco. After working at Dreem Health, a 
               neurotech company expanding access to sleep care, I was eager to join the Decision Lab and understand public
               reception to neuro innovation. My contributions to our Neuroethics Survey Project seek to outline how race,
               ethnicty, and rurality influence beliefs about therapeutic implanated neural devices. Previously, I've explored 
               social cognition, dementia, and I hope to pursue further research in neural interfaces at UCSF.


               I recieved my B.A. in Neuroscience with a minor in Social Anthropology from Harvard Univeristy. Determined to 
               bridge the slow, yet insightful practices of research with the rapid, socially impactful capital of investing, 
               I interned at BrainMind, a community of neuroscientists, investors, philathropists, and entrepreneurs looking to 
               bring socially-impactful neuro innovatios to market, during college. While at BrainMind, I devoted my time to 
               developing its flagship, Neuroethics Advisory Commitee. Convening policymakers, academics, entrepreneurs, and investors
               we sought to challenge this multidisplincary group to rethink how we sustainably integrate ethics into neuro innovation.
               
               Outside of neurotech, ethics, and medicine, I enjoy working out, and playing guitar and basketball.

  description: I am a medical student at the University of San Francisco. I'm fascinated by the mind-body connection,
               particularly how medical illness and mental health interact to shape human behavior. I'm excited to 
               join the Decision Lab to explore how personal values evolve over the course of Alzheimer's disease and 
               frontotemporal dementia.

               I previously attended the University of Georgia, where I earned degrees in women's studies and political
               science. My interdisciplinary background informs my interest in the intersection of philosophy, anthropology,
               and medicine.

               In my free time, I enjoy road and trail running, visiting museums, and reading.
