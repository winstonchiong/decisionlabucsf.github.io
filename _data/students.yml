  description: I am a medical student at the University of Califonria, San Francisco. After working at Dreem Health, a 
               neurotech company expanding access to sleep care, I was eager to join the Decision Lab and understand public
               reception to neuro innovation. My contributions to our Neuroethics Survey Project seek to outline how race,
               ethnicty, and rurality influence beliefs about therapeutic implanated neural devices. Previously, I've explored 
               social cognition, dementia, and I hope to pursue further research in neural interfaces at UCSF.


               I recieved my B.A. in Neuroscience with a minor in Social Anthropology from Harvard Univeristy. Determined to 
               bridge the slow, yet insightful practices of research with the rapid, socially impactful capital of investing, 
               I interned at BrainMind, a community of neuroscientists, investors, philathropists, and entrepreneurs looking to 
               bring socially-impactful neuro innovatios to market, during college. While at BrainMind, I devoted my time to 
               developing its flagship, Neuroethics Advisory Commitee. Convening policymakers, academics, entrepreneurs, and investors
               we sought to challenge this multidisplincary group to rethink how we sustainably integrate ethics into neuro innovation.
               
               Outside of neurotech, ethics, and medicine, I enjoy working out, and playing guitar and basketball.

  description: I am a rising fourth year UCSF medical student spending a yearlong research rotation at the Decision Lab prior 
               to submitting residency applications in the fall of 2023. My academic interests include developmental 
               neuroscience, cognitive neurology, medical ethics, and medical education. The Decision Lab's unique neuroethics focus 
               is what drew me to join, and I am excited to contribute to our Caregiver Survey by leading the Financial 
               Toxicity project, investigating the impact of the cost of dementia care on the financial wellbeing of dementia 
               caregivers and their families. Having had multiple family members struggle with dementia in the last few years of 
               their lives, this project is of personal relevance to me and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to 
               the growing body of literature outlining how best to support dementia caregivers over the course of their loved ones' 
               disease progression.

               My fascination with the brain began during my time at the University of Notre Dame, where I received my B.S. in 
               Neuroscience and Behavior in 2018. As an undergraduate, I spent time in Dr. Jill Lany’s cognitive psychology lab, which was 
               dedicated to the study of language acquisition in infants. There, I processed auditory data for a project investigating 
               the effects of infant-directed speech on cognitive development. Next, I went on to the Saban Research Institute at 
               Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Working in Dr. Bradley Peterson’s Institute for the Developing Mind, I processed 
               DTI data for a study delineating developmental trajectories in the neurocircuitry involved in self-regulation during 
               the transition from childhood to adolescence. I am eager to foster my interest in developmental neuroscience by exploring 
               projects relating to the opposite end of the developmental spectrum here at the Decision Lab.

               In my free time, I enjoy reading, yoga, gardening, and trying new restaurants.
