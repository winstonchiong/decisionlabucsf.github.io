<p>One of the general aims of the lab (and often a personal aim for research
coordinators and students) is to get members involved in authoring
papers and posters. (Note: much of what follows primarily concerns authorship of
papers. Because posters aren’t fully peer-reviewed, standards for authorship are
less stringent and less contested.)</p>
<div id="why-it-matters-and-what-it-means" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="7.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Why it matters, and what it means<a href="authorship.html#why-it-matters-and-what-it-means" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>One source of ethical problems with authorship is that it serves several
functions in science and academia, and these multiple roles can give rise to
conflict and misunderstandings–both within research groups, and from one group
to another. Among other things, we use authorship for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establishing credit for work.</strong> This is perhaps the key evidence used for
promotions and faculty appointments, and is often a critical component of
applications to graduate or professional school, residencies, postdocs, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of productive collaboration.</strong> This can be important, e.g., if our lab
is planning to apply for a grant application with another lab. Having existing
papers with authors from both groups would show a track record of working
together.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility for the integrity of work.</strong> In some ways, this might be the most
important yet most overlooked aspect of authorship. Authors are each responsible
for ensuring that work is conducted rigorously and reported accurately.
Assignment of authorship is relatedly important for detecting conflicts of
interest in a piece of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can lead to several unfortunately common problems.
<em>Ghost authorship</em> is when
someone who authored or co-authored a paper is not listed as an author; e.g.,
if a pharma company scientist drafts a paper, which is then published under the
name of a prominent academic. <em>Courtesy authorship</em> is when someone who didn’t
author a paper is listed as an author; e.g., if someone adds their department
chair as an author to curry favor with them. Relatedly, sometimes people will
<em>include an author’s name without permission</em>, either due to sloppiness or in
hopes that a paper will be reviewed more favorably if a prominent scientist is
listed as an author. This is a problem because authors are all responsible for
the integrity of a paper.</p>
<p>Criteria for authorship vary across disciplines, and sometimes across journals
in the same discipline. As a common starting point for discussion, we use the
<a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html" target="_blank">ICMJE guidelines</a>
applied by medical journals because
they’re the most explicitly codified. In outline, the 4 criteria that must all
be met for authorship are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Intellectual contribution</li>
<li>B. Drafting or critically revising the paper</li>
<li>C. Approval of the final draft</li>
<li>D. Accountability (if the integrity of the work is challenged)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many problems in authorship come from discrepancies in the contributions that
people make to (A) and (B). For example, someone who helps to initiate a project
but then leaves might make major contributions to the design of the work, but if
this person is not involved in drafting or revising the paper would not count
as an author.</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s very important that <em>before writing begins on a paper</em>,
consideration should be given to (1) who has made significant intellectual
contributions to be eligible for authorship, and (2) whether or how these people
can be given a reasonable opportunity to contribute to drafting or revising the
manuscript in order to count as authors.</p>
<p>If you are planning to be 1st author on a paper (see below), please consult the
<a href="https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=406066097#Publication&amp;AcknowledgementGuidelines-Authorship&amp;CoreSupport" target="_blank">MAC Authorship Guidelines</a>
<em>when you are conceiving</em> the project and <em>as you are drafting</em> the paper, to
ensure that you’re not leaving out someone who should be eligible for authorship.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Authorship order<a href="authorship.html#authorship-order" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The author positions that have established meanings across biomedical
institutions are first, second, and last author.
The first author is usually the person who initiated a project and did most of
the work, including organizing the other authors and managing the submission
process. The last author should be the mentor or supervisor, and is responsible
for “big picture” issues–placing findings in context, targeting a journal, etc.
The person who did the next most to complete the work is the second author, and
pretty much everyone else is a “middle author.”</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll see two people listed as “co-first authors.” Since inevitably
one person’s name does have to come before the other’s, credit doesn’t really get
shared equally, so in most cases we should just make an active decision about who
is first and who is second.</p>

<div id="involvement-of-rcs-and-students" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="7.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Involvement of RCs and students<a href="authorship.html#involvement-of-rcs-and-students" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Involvement of more junior members of the research team as authors requires
planning in advance, to ensure that they do make sufficient intellectual
contributions and play a significant enough role in drafting the manuscript to
count as authors. For example, while senior colleagues may plausibly contribute
to (B) by drawing on their past scientific and publishing expertise to critically
revise a completed draft, it is less plausible that junior colleagues are in a
position to contribute in this way. Involvement of more junior colleagues
requires planning at the outset of drafting. In my experience, the most feasible
drafting roles for RCs and students include: writing
parts of the Methods and Results, creating figures/tables, and organizing
references. Reserving a paragraph or a figure for a junior colleague to
contribute, <em>even if
it’s something the first author could have done</em>, can be a way of ensuring that
RCs or students who deserve credit for their intellectual contributions (e.g.,
of acquiring or analyzing data) also fulfill drafting criteria for authorship.</p>
<p>If you are either an RC or student and are interested in becoming the first author of a paper, we will meet to discuss what this means for you in more detail. As a rough outline (see more below), papers for scientific/medical journals usually have the structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, if I’m senior author I should expect to have more responsibility for
the Introduction and Discussion, since these often involve putting our findings
in a broader context. So while I expect you to have principal responsibility for
the Methods, Results, and any figures or tables (including organizing the
contributions of middle authors), I don’t expect too much from you in the
Introduction and Discussion. It’s often a worthwhile exercise to have you take
a first stab at drafting them, but in my experience I almost always rewrite them
when RCs or students are first authors. So: don’t agonize too much over
them–writer’s block over the Introduction and Discussion should never be the
cause of delays in completing a manuscript draft.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Choosing a journal<a href="authorship.html#choosing-a-journal" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This has gotten more complicated in recent years, in part because of the phenomenon
of <strong>predatory journals</strong>. These are journals that often have names very similar
to highly-respected journals, but that don’t actually exercise peer review or
any real editorial oversight. These predatory journals often use a version of
the “open-access” model–while legitimate open-access journals (like the PLoS
journals) charge the authors a fee to cover the costs of editing so that readers
can access papers for free, predatory open-access journals accept every paper sent
to them so that they can collect fees from authors without actually providing
editorial services.</p>
<p>If you’re not already familiar with the journals in a given domain, it’s
probably worthwhile to use the <a href="https://ucsf.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://uclibs.org/PID/36787" target="_blank">Journal Impact Factor</a>
as a rough guide to journals’ reputation. Impact factors are pretty flawed
measures of journal quality (think of them like U.S. News college
rankings), but they can give you a general impression of journals’ reputations
and at least hopefully help distinguish predatory journals from similar-sounding
legitimate journals.</p>
<p>Another great tool is <a href="http://jane.biosemantics.org/" target="_blank">JANE (Journal/Author Name Estimator)</a>.
This is a tool where you can input your title and/or abstract,
and it will suggest journals (including rough impact factors) based on keyword
and textual similarity. You can also use this tool to find articles and authors
likely to be relevant to your work.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Title<a href="authorship.html#title" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Most good scientific papers have a straightforward, simple finding–usually
either of the form <strong>A &gt; B</strong> or <strong>A ~ B</strong>–which should similarly arise from a
straightforward question. For your paper, you want your potential audience to
quickly grasp your research question/finding so they can figure out whether it’s
relevant to their interests. (And then hopefully read it!) It’s great if titles
can include the <strong>Predictor</strong>, the <strong>Outcome</strong>, and the <strong>Population</strong>; e.g., Han and
colleagues, “Financial literacy is associated with white matter integrity in old
age.” Someone who is totally naive about this literature can still figure out
the finding and probably can infer the research question. An expert in this
literature can also figure out the motivation and relevance of the finding,
and probably can also figure out much of the methods (a financial literacy
questionnaire for the predictor, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the outcome,
in a healthy older population).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.3</span> Introduction (<em>present tense</em> for what is currently known)<a href="authorship.html#introduction-present-tense-for-what-is-currently-known" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>If your finding takes the form <strong>A &gt; B</strong> or <strong>A ~ B</strong>, your introduction should
show why it would matter to know that A &gt; B or A ~ B. Usually in 3-4 elegant
paragraphs (except for psychology journals, those introductions are crazy
long) you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish the scientific, clinical or public health importance of the topic</li>
<li>briefly summarize previous research in this area</li>
<li>identify shortcomings or gaps in current knowledge (focused on problems that
your study will fix)</li>
<li>show how your study addresses these shortcomings or gaps (sketching an
overview of your hypothesis, design, sample and methods)</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, in the introduction you want to get your audience interested in the
question that your study is set up to answer.</p>
<p>One classic logical organization for a scientific introduction, which I think
most scientists actually do quite poorly, is the “funnel.” Understanding the
logic of the funnel will go a long way in helping you design impactful studies.
Recall that your study is only a tiny contribution (maybe the work of a handful
of people over a couple years, studying a few hundred subjects in one area) to a
vast accumulated scientific literature. How is this little study going to move
the field forward or even just change how your reader thinks about the topic?
If you use the funnel organization, you start out with a really big problem that
many people care about, and gradually show that the answer to this big problem
depends on smaller questions: how to measure A, how B is connected to C, how to
deal with inconsistent findings between study D and study E. So while the funnel
begins quite wide, as the argument continues the reader can see that a critical
part of this wide question is the narrow question at the end of the funnel.
Ideally it’s this pivotal, small question that unlocks the various problems set
up in the introduction that your manuscript is prepared to answer.</p>

<p>Now demonstrate to the reader how you plan to show that A &gt; B or A ~ B. Note
that if the study has a <a href="Open%20Science%20Framework">preregistered protocol</a>,
it’s best to try to keep the
description of the methods similar to the description in the protocol–when
feasible, don’t even paraphrase but instead keep the exact same wording. Key
overall elements of the Method are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In clinical research, specifying the type of design (e.g., retrospective vs. 
prospective, case-control vs. cohort vs. RCT)</li>
<li>Research subjects: the population, the inclusion/exclusion criteria,
the controls</li>
<li>Measurements, both for predictors and outcome variables. It’s important to
organize these in a way that’s friendly to the reader. Usually it’s most
straightforward to group the predictor variables together and then the outcome
variables. Also see Browner for thoughts about how to convey the appropriate
level of detail for your target audience.</li>
<li>Analysis: your statistical plan and <em>why</em> you used the tests that you used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you explain decisions you made that might seem odd to reviewers (e.g.,
excluding subjects and your rationale for doing so), and any missing data and
how missing data were handled.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.5</span> Results (<em>past tense</em> for what you found)<a href="authorship.html#results-past-tense-for-what-you-found" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A tricky thing for new scientific writers is understanding the relationship, on
one hand, between the Methods and Results; and on the other hand, between the
Results and the Discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>“All results must have methods; all methods must have results.” Basically,
if you describe some procedure in your Methods, then whatever happened needs to
show up in your Results. Similarly, if you describe some finding in your Results,
your reviewers need to be able to figure out how you arrived at that finding
from your Methods.</li>
<li>In general, the Results are supposed to describe what you found, and the
Discussion is supposed to interpret them. So the Results are not supposed to
include any interpretation–sometimes you can get away with something like, “As
predicted, A &gt; B,” but some reviewers will balk even at that. Also, there should
be no new results in the Discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s really important to structure your results so that your main or most
interesting finding is obvious and easy to find. You don’t want it buried in the
middle of a long paragraph or hugely complicated table or figure. The normal
order is to start with a quick rundown of descriptive results (who your research
participants were and what happened to them), and then get to your main analytic
finding. Usually you want to keep your strongest findings first, and simple
results (like main effects) before complex ones (interaction effects,
multivariate models, validity checks); it’s also helpful when possible to mirror
the ordering of your Methods.</p>
<p>One especially tricky thing is figuring out which results just to describe in
the main text, as opposed to creating a figure or table. See below for more on
figures. Usually if your result is just a matter of one or two
numbers (e.g., your finding is A &gt; B and you want to show A and B’s point
estimates and confidence intervals), then you should just put this in text.</p>
<p>Overall, the text and the tables/figures should <em>complement</em> one another.
As Browner (Chapter 5) notes, new investigators often write the text around
their tables and figures, e.g., “Table 1 shows… The multivariate results can
be seen in Table 2…” See Browner for suggestions on how to use the text to
help your reader interpret the data in your figures and tables.</p>

<p>It’s helpful to go back to the question that you posed in the Introduction, and
then to indicate that your study has answered this question. Synthesize and
summarize the key findings, including particular mention of any that are
surprising or otherwise noteworthy. Try to use words rather than numbers to do
this; if numbers are included they should be kept simple.</p>
<p>Then write about what you think the results mean, indicating how strongly you
believe them. Some people treat the Discussion as a “sales job”–I don’t think
this is a good way to view your relationship to the reader. My preference is to
try to perform a service to the reader, by helping the reader to place your
findings in appropriate context. So if you think your findings really do
“demonstrate” that A &gt; B or A ~ B, go ahead and say so; but if you know that the
data admit of alternative interpretations, you can signal this by saying that
your findings “suggest” that A &gt; B, or that a reasonable interpretation is that
A &gt; B. In some sense, a good Discussion can parallel a good Introduction; while
the Introduction is a “funnel” that zooms in from a wide question to the narrow
focus of the individual study, the Discussion turns this into an “hourglass” and
zooms us back out to the big questions we started with. (But Discussions are
generally formatted more loosely than Introductions, so don’t work too hard to
make the “hourglass” idea fit.)</p>
<p>If there are special features of your study you might choose to highlight them,
but avoid bragging or claims of priority (“this is the first/largest…”).
Briefly synthesize previous research to show how your work relates to the
existing literature. Set up your limitations and explain them (e.g., why you
used the sample you did, or why a given statistical model didn’t fit), including
not only design/methodological limitations, but also limitations of your
interpretation of findings.</p>

<p>As with our <a href="guidelines-for-clinical-interactions.html#guidelines-for-clinical-interactions">Guidelines for Clinical Interactions</a>, we aim to use person-centered
language and appropriate terminology, particularly when writing about older
adults and people with dementia, The American Geriatrics Society has some
<a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/15325415/forauthors.html" target="_blank">helpful guidelines</a>
on this (scroll down to “JOURNAL STYLE”).</p>
<p>Overall, the preferred term for someone with a disease, e.g. Alzheimer’s disease,
is “person/people with Alzheimer’s disease.” We should be cautious about
describing someone as a “patient” (e.g., “patient with Alzheimer’s disease”)
unless they’re specifically being discussed in a medical context or in the
context of a patient-clinician relationship. In a research context, terms like
“participant with dementia” may also be used. Also consider “care recipient” and
“caregiver” if the paper specifically discusses someone in the context of a
caregiving relationship. At nearly all costs we avoid referring to people by
using acronyms (e.g., “ADs,” “bvFTDs,” “PWDs” [for person with dementia]).</p>
<p>Finally, for people writing about caregiver/care recipient relationships,
there’s been increasing attention to appropriate language for caregiving. One
useful resource is an editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,
<a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jgs.15988" target="_blank">Words Matter: The Language of Family Caregiving</a>.
The key point is to avoid the terms “informal” and “formal” caregivers for
caregivers who are unpaid and paid, respectively. See Table 1 in the paper for
more detailed recommendations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> More about figures<a href="authorship.html#more-about-figures" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>For an overall guide to how to communicate statistics with figures, I strongly
recommend
<a href="https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/">Best Practices for Data Visualization</a>,
a guide by the Royal Statistical Society but very broadly relevant. Another
resource you might consider consulting is Rougier, Droettboom &amp; Bourne,
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833">Ten simple rules for better figures</a>,
PLoS Computational Biology 2014.</p>
<p><img src="img/handbook-authorship-01-vector-raster.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>One important thing to understand about figures is the difference between
vector and raster graphics. Raster graphics are the most familiar to people–these
are the images created by digital cameras, and are composed of a grid
of tiny squares called pixels (similar to needlepoint). To edit a raster image,
we use programs like
Paint or Photoshop to change the colors assigned to each pixel. Vector graphics
are instead made up of lines and curves that are mathematically defined. (If
you’ve used the drawing tools in Powerpoint or Google Slides, these are vector
graphics.) To edit a vector image, we use programs like Illustrator or Affinity
Designer to move or change the points that define the lines and curves.</p>
<p>Because raster graphics are actually made up of tiny squares, there is a limit
to how far you can magnify them–zoom in too close, and you get jagged effects
where what is supposed to be a curve or slanted line turns out actually to be
blocky. Meanwhile, vector graphics are defined mathematically, so you can zoom
in on them indefinitely. Related to this, it’s very easy to convert vector
graphics to raster graphics, but it’s hard to go in the other direction.</p>
<p>Most figures, like line or bar graphs created by Stata or R, are produced as
vector graphics. These should be saved in an appropriate vector format (most
commonly EPS, sometimes AI), and edited as vector graphics. If you convert them
to raster, then it will be nearly impossible to edit them again as vector
graphics.</p>
<p>Some other figures (such as from neuroimaging) are generated as raster graphics.
When editing these, please be aware that the screen resolution of your monitor
(often something like 72 dots per inch) can be much lower than print resolution
(300-600 dpi). If your graphics are intended for publication, they need to be
created and edited in print resolution and you should check that they look
good when viewed close-up.</p>
<div id="style-and-design" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="7.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> Style and design<a href="authorship.html#style-and-design" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As emphasized by Rougier and colleagues, do not just use the defaults from the
stats program (Stata, R, Matlab…) used to create your figures. Instead, you
want your figures to demonstrate your active thinking about the most revealing
and helpful ways to display your data–e.g., if there are multiple colors, this
should be because the colors denote something meaningful or informative that
you’re signaling your reader to pay attention to, and not just because the
colors are part of the default settings on your stats package.</p>
<p>You have two main options for customizing your figures. First, you can modify
output settings of your stats program, and in this way tweak your labels,
legends, line thickness and color, point markers and so forth. Second, you can
save the figure in an editable <em>vector format</em> such as EPS, and then open the
image file in a vector editing program such as Illustrator or Affinity Designer.
In practice, I usually rely on a combination of the two approaches, as some
changes are easier and more efficient to do in a stats program, and others are
easier to do in an editing program.</p>
<p>For consistency, I recommend changing all figure labels to <strong>Helvetica</strong>, unless
another font is specified by the journal you’re submitting to. (Stylistic
consistency will help when we want to combine figures from different projects,
e.g. in future grant applications or presentations. In general, our lab
products, following UCSF style, use the fonts <strong>Helvetica</strong> and <strong>Garamond</strong>.
In a pinch you can use Arial in place of Helvetica, but I will complain about it.)
See the website-and-identity/fonts folder in the R: drive.</p>
<p>Finally, when possible it’s nice to use the UCSF color scheme. Just using
any consistent color scheme will help later on when we want to combine
figures from different projects, and relying on the UCSF scheme will help things
look consistent on posters. To access the UCSF color scheme, go to the
<a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu/brand-guide/print-colors" target="_blank">UCSF brand guide for colors</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/handbook-authorship-02-ucsf-colors.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>You’ll notice that each color has numbers associated for RGB (quantities of red,
green and blue light). To use these in
your program, you need to go beyond the preset
colors–look for a color palette or an option for More Colors… Then from that
find the option to enter the numeric RGB values directly (rather than trying to
choose a shade that matches), and use the values from
the UCSF color scheme:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Notes on posters<a href="authorship.html#notes-on-posters" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I like to think of posters as preparation for writing the paper that will
eventually result from your project. Selfishly, in the poster session you’ll
want to talk to people who know enough about your topic or methods to be
helpful in your thinking about how to write up the project–or,
maybe if you’re lucky, to PIs or other people
whom you’re trying to impress. Communicating your findings to other people who
are not in the area is rewarding but of secondary importance.</p>
<p>Trying to view posters in poster sessions is cognitively overwhelming. Some
conferences like SfN have
thousands of posters. Personally, I’ve found that I can only take in a handful
of posters in a session, and I actively ignore everything else in the poster
hall because otherwise details get jumbled together and I don’t remember
anything. When you’re designing your poster, think about ways to specifically
draw in the people you want to talk to.</p>
<p>Depending on what stage you’re at in your project, you might be looking
particularly for feedback on your framework, or methods, or analysis, or
findings. Whatever it is, you want it to be obvious from a distance to people
who are interested in that area that your poster is relevant to them. E.g.,
use eye-catching figures, but <strong>only</strong> if those figures quickly communicate
what your project is about, and particularly the parts that you’re looking for
feedback about. And knowing that people are cognitively overtaxed, don’t make
them work to figure out what you mean: use labels and headings to help people
know what they’re looking at and what you want them to think.</p>
<p><img src="img/handbook-authorship-04-mock-poster.png" /></p>
<p>Here’s a mockup of a poster (not the actual one–don’t examine too closely) that
demonstrates some strategies for organizing a poster:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-value</strong> material is placed at the top of each panel: on the left,
the conceptual framework and motivation; in the middle, the major figure; and on
the right, the takeaways. This makes these elements easier to spot from a
distance in a crowded hall.</li>
<li><em>Finer details</em> are placed at the bottom: these are things you’re including
for thoroughness and might be of interest to someone who’s already interested
in the poster, but aren’t things that you expect to draw people in. Here I’ve
put background info on the study from which the data is derived, a table
characterizing the participants (usually “Table 1,” but here crammed at the
bottom and in tiny font), and Acknowledgments/References.</li>
<li>The poster is organized to make it easy for people to visually scan and find
the parts they’re interested in. There’s a fair amount of white space, so the text isn’t
all crowded on top of itself. (Even though this required us to make the font
size a little smaller than it might otherwise have been.) The headers use a
consistent font/color convention and a familiar Intro-Methods-Results-Discussion
format.</li>
<li>When someone is reading a paper, it’s the only thing they’re looking at, so
you don’t always have to spell everything out for them. When someone is looking
at a poster, it’s one thing among many others in a crowded and distracting
poster hall, so you have to make it very obvious what
lessons they’re supposed to draw or they’ll get frustrated and move on.
Here, each figure in the Results section has a descriptive title, and
also includes brief text to help viewers know what’s going on. Similarly with
the takeaways: try to come up with two or three really quick and clear messages
that viewers should walk away with at the end.</li>
<li>Note that the graphics use the old UCSF color scheme; the idea was to make
them easy to combine from different
sources without clashing. (The “Care Ecosystem study” diagram is taken directly
from Kate Possin’s paper about the Care Ecosystem.) The old color scheme doesn’t
differ too much from the new one, but we should try to use the new color scheme
going forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last picky thing. The Windows versions of Microsoft Word and Powerpoint have
an annoying issue where, if you use “Save As…” with the “Save as type: PDF”
option, they convert all instances of Helvetica to Arial. To get around this,
use the “Print…” menu and choose “Microsoft Print to PDF” (or similar options
from Foxit or Adobe if you have them installed) as the printer. (Not an issue
on Macs.)</p>
