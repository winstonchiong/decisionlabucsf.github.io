<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 3</span> Lab Resources Overview<a href="lab-resources-overview.html#lab-resources-overview" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Here is a very general overview of lab-wide resources that everyone in both
sides of the lab should be familiar with. (Some projects
also use specific tools that should be separately documented.) As one broad
principle to keep in mind: research coordinators in the lab
typically stay 2-3 years, but many of our projects span a much longer period of
time. We need everyone to perform protocols consistently,
and to document their work carefully, so that the people who follow you can
continue your work.</p>
<div id="slack" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> <a href="http://ucsfdecisionlab.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a><a href="lab-resources-overview.html#slack" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Slack is the primary method of communication within the lab. You can customize
your notification preferences (particularly important on the mobile app) so you
are notified of important messages but also are not overwhelmed. Use the ‘@’
feature to get my attention if I need to get involved in a conversation, and
make sure that you’re subscribed to the right channels. Key channels for
everyone are #general and #random. For our new <a href="intro-to-the-memory-and-aging-center.html#our-lab-projects-in-context">big lab projects</a>
in 2025 we have work channels set up for #decisions-for-others (a continuation
of a channel previously labeled #hillblom and then #branch for online studies
of decision-making in healthy older adults), #neurotech
(now focused mainly on HCD Neurotech grant funded in 2024, but with some
residual wrap-up work on our previous NIH-funded neuroethics grants), and
#personal-values. Valerie’s been hosting a rich set of readings with discussion
at #disability-studies, and a channel for #code has been used mostly for
conversations about <a href="rstudio-analysis-pathway.html#step-0-review-software-tools">R and RStudio</a>. More or less
in the archives are channels for older lab projects: #caregivers, #dma, and
#gbd. We also have channels for non-work-related conversation
at #decisionzbop (a channel for music conversation), #food-opinions,
#im_upset (originally started early in the COVID-19 pandemic when that topic
overwhelmed all our other channels, now a general hub for concern about the
state of the world), and #social for informal non-work gatherings and
conversations that don’t involve me directly. As a matter of lab policy, we do
<strong>not</strong> have private/locked Slack channels.</p>
<p>Two important caveats about Slack:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Slack is not considered secure or HIPAA-compliant. No PHI (protected health
information) belongs there, and in general any discussion involving individual
research participants should be conducted via SECURE: e-mail rather than Slack.</li>
<li>Slack is not an archive. We can search in our lab account, but it’s not that
easy to go back and reconstruct details of conversations and decisions made.
So we use Slack for rapid, concurrent conversation–but anything that
we might want
to refer to later needs to be documented, most likely in GitHub.</li>

<p>Our lab website is one place where we communicate what we do and share our work with the
outside world. This is hosted on our public GitHub repository, which you will
need a GitHub account to edit. See the README at
<a href="https://github.com/DecisionLabUCSF/decisionlabucsf.github.io" target="_blank">github.com/DecisionLabUCSF/decisionlabucsf.github.io</a>
to learn how to add
your team profile. Because this is a public repository, anyone can read the code
that we use to build the website, and it also has an open license inviting other
investigators to use this code to design their own websites if they wish.</p>
<p>As I say in the README, you can think of GitHub as like a supercharged Google
Docs for code, allowing multiple people to work on code together, keeping track
of who made what changes and when, making it easy to reverse changes that have
been made, and allowing different versions to be developed at the same time.
Tools like this are commonly used by software companies to maintain quality and
avoid/fix bugs. We won’t be using all of the sophisticated tools in GitHub that
they use, but generally I think scientists have a lot to learn from software
developers: Facebook and Google can’t survive with sloppy code and neither can we.</p>

<div id="private-github-repo" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> <a href="https://github.com/UCSFMemoryAndAging/decisionlab" target="_blank">Private Github repo</a><a href="lab-resources-overview.html#private-github-repo" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In addition to our public repository, we also have a private repository that
only lab members can view, which is where we document and edit our code, and
maintain
electronic lab notebooks. See the README at
<a href="https://github.com/UCSFMemoryAndAging/decisionlab" target="_blank">github.com/UCSFMemoryAndAging/decisionlab</a>
for details once your account
is fully set up with permissions. A basic way of working with GitHub is just
editing files on the GitHub website. However, to use GitHub for code that can be
utilized by statistical/analytic packages like R and MATLAB, you will need to
synchronize the lab repo to a folder on your computer (like a more technical
version of Dropbox or Box). For more details on how to do this, see Section 9 of
this lab handbook, <a href="rstudio-analysis-pathway.html#rstudio-analysis-pathway">RStudio Analysis Pathway</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some key initial points:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>As with Slack, no protected data. PIDNs and other assigned identifiers can
pop up infrequently, but we should avoid other participant-level data, and
especially PHI and participant identifiers (names, dates of birth, addresses,
demographics, etc.)</li>
<li>GitHub works best with text-editable files: code, markdown files, HTML,
notebooks and the like. GitHub is much less useful for big files like images,
Word and Powerpoint files, and they tend to clog things up for everyone else who
is syncing to the repo. Images should be reduced in size whenever possible, and
Microsoft Office files (Word, Powerpoint) should stay out of GitHub and go on
the R: drive somewhere.</li>
<li>Please be consistent about naming and file organization, and be obsessive
about documentation and comments! Again, other people will pick your work up
after you, so please be kind to them in advance. (Quick note that things can
get messy if files or folders get renamed after they’re in use, so it’s good to
be thoughtful and pick good names for things at the outset–see more about this
in the README for the repo.)</li>
<li>Try to keep line length to about 80 characters, and commit-pull-push!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="r-drive-rgroupschiong" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> R: drive (R:\groups\chiong)<a href="lab-resources-overview.html#r-drive-rgroupschiong" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>To recap some points from above: Slack can’t be used for protected data or
discussion of individual research participants, and isn’t an archive. GitHub is
an archive for code and documentation, but also shouldn’t be used for protected
data or identifiers (and documentation about individual participants should be
limited), and shouldn’t be used for large files such as Microsoft Office
documents. So: for our quantitative projects we use the R: drive for large
datasets, especially those including personal identifiers, and other useful
resources that are too large to put in GitHub. (Quick personal note: I’m often
working from my laptop and home computer, on which I only mount the R: drive
intermittently–so if you need me to look at something that doesn’t involve PHI,
it will often be a lot faster if it lives in GitHub or is
temporarily available in Slack.) For instructions on how to mount the R: drive
on your computer, see the Technology section of
<a href="https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/MACipedia/MACipedia+Home" target="_blank">MACipedia</a>.</p>
<p>For using statistical packages, a model for how to utilize the R: drive with the
GitHub repo is described in Section 9: <a href="rstudio-analysis-pathway.html#rstudio-analysis-pathway">RStudio Analysis Pathway</a>). As a
general overview, the pathway is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Clone the decisionlab GitHub repo to your computer.</li>
<li>Save original dataset (e.g., a .csv or Excel file from Qualtrics or E-Prime)
on the R: drive, and never write to this file again.</li>
<li>Clean the data, using a script and a logging file that are saved in GitHub,
creating a cleaned data file that is saved back on the R: drive.</li>
<li>Analyze the data using other script and logging files that are saved in
GitHub, generating new data files and graphics as necessary that are saved on
the R: drive.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since everyone is using the R: drive for a variety of projects (which will
continue on after you leave), keeping our group folder organized is a challenge!
Please refer to Guide.docx on the R: drive which explains how the subfolders are
organized.</p>
</div>
<div id="box" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> <a href="https:/ucsf.box.com" target="_blank">Box</a><a href="lab-resources-overview.html#box" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In our qualitative projects we are now using Box, which is better for
involving non-MAC colleagues like in MCL (Medical Cultures Lab) and non-UCSF
collaborators. Note that there’s one way in which Box isn’t as good for data
security as the R: drive, in that if people have Box Sync enabled then they’ll
be carrying around copies of all of the data for a given project on their
own laptops. (This is why drive encryption is important, but even so I’ve
decided that I’m just not going to think too much about all of these copies of
our data wandering around the world in people’s personal devices.) For
all of our data projects, we should regularly review who including our
collaborators has access to a given folder, and whether such access remains
necessary or justified.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> <a href="https://redcap.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">REDCap</a><a href="lab-resources-overview.html#redcap" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Somewhat new for 2025, we are now using REDCap for tracking participants in our
studies, including enrollment and consent, and the completion of study
activities. REDCap is a very useful tool though it has a bit of a learning
curve, in part reflecting some advanced capabilities (used for running things
like multi-site randomized clinical trials) and options that go beyond our
anticipated uses. It has very good resources for securing data and tracking who
should have access to which data, though we’ve heard from other researchers that
coordination across site (e.g., with non-UCSF collaborators) can get messy with
things like permissions. We’re still learning how to use it, though I’m
enthusiastic about it and have found it to be a big improvement so far over what
we were doing before.</p>

<p>“Open science” and our lab’s relationship to this idea are discussed in detail
in Section 8, <a href="reliability-and-open-science.html#reliability-and-open-science">Reliability and Open Science</a>. We use OSF to host preregistrations of our
studies (data collection and analytic plans that we try to write before we begin
a study, and which other researchers can check against our work later on) as
well as public datasets and code. To avoid concerns about access and permissions,
we’ve been posting all of these materials on my own account, even when they are
authored by (and credited to) other lab members.</p>
<p>Organization in OSF is like a Russian doll, with components nested inside of
larger components nested inside of still larger components. At the top level is
the user’s account, which can contain a number of different projects. Inside
each project could be a number of smaller subprojects, which each might
represent some piece of the larger project such as the work intended to result
in a particular planned publication:</p>
<p><img src="img/handbook_03_resources-01-osf.png" /></p>
<p>A key distinction in OSF is between what’s “public,” meaning anyone in the world can see it,
and what’s “private.” For many projects, this might proceed in different stages,
where things start out as private and we gradually open them up to public. It’s
useful to note that in OSF, a private component can have public subcomponents
inside of it, but a public component can’t have private subcomponents. In this
schematic, there’s a private “project 1” that has three components corresponding
to three planned publications that are in different stages of completion. For
manuscript 1, it’s already complete and has been submitted to a journal. As the
work is finished, everything is public: the preregistration, the data, and the
code. For manuscript 2, we’ve already planned out the data collection and
analysis plans, and so we’ve posted a public preregistration of the project that
anyone can read. However, since we’re still working on it, we haven’t made the
data or code public yet. For manuscript 3, we’re still planning the data
collection and analysis plans, so there’s a private draft registration that
hasn’t been posted and made public yet (and the data and code don’t yet exist.)</p>
<p>Currently we have a few big “Projects” in OSF that are private, corresponding to
our previous set of <a href="intro-to-the-memory-and-aging-center.html#our-lab-projects-in-context">big lab projects</a> listed on our
website: Neurotech (in “Population survey panel studies”), DMA (“Decision-making
in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias”) and BRANCH (“Online studies of
decision-making in healthy aging”). (We preregistered GBD before we came up with
this organization system, so the GBD projects are scattered in their own folders.)
I’ll be creating some new projects for our new 2024 grants soon.</p>
<p>If you are writing a preregistration for the first time, consider looking at
examples such as

<p>LAVA is the MAC’s primary database for all research-related patient and
participant information, e.g. demographics, visits and scheduling, research
diagnoses, specimens.</p>
<p>For our current projects, we use LAVA for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting participants’ contact information to call/email them about enrolling
in one of our studies</li>
<li>Enrolling participants under the ‘Enrollment’ and ‘Scheduling’ tabs once we
have seen them for a study</li>
<li>Utilizing the Contact Log when reaching out to participants in our studies,
so that our communication is coordianted with MAC parent projects and with
other subprojects</li>
<li>Looking up participants’ most recent (and past) diagnoses for tracking
enrollment numbers or running data analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>LAVA Query 5 is a (fairly) user-friendly querying tool that allows you to pull
information from a selected subgroup of (or all) participants from the main LAVA
dataset. You can access this on the front page of the LAVA website.</p>
<p>If you will be running any kind of analysis, you’ll most likely use LAVA Query 5 to
pull relevant participant information, download it as a csv file, and merge with
your study data files.</p>

<p><strong><del>Excel.</del></strong> In general, Microsoft Excel is not an appropriate tool for data
analysis or manipulations that are intended for presentation or publication. It
can be used to explore datasets, but usually this is best done within a proper
statistical/analytic software package such as R, Stata or Matlab. Best estimates
are that between 2% and 5% of Excel formulas have uncorrected coding errors, so
if you are using a worksheet with at least 35 formulas then it probably has at
least one error you don’t know about (and if you’re not particularly expert in
using Excel, probably many more). Field studies have shown that almost all
large spreadsheets in the corporate world have multiple errors. If capitalism
supposedly works by efficiently utilizing information to optimally allocate
resources where they can be best used, then someone please explain
to me why businesses still install this program on their employees’ desktops.</p>
<p>In 2012, JPMorgan Chase lost $6.2 billion by relying on a risk model coded in
Excel that included a simple formula calculation error. As
<a href="https://baselinescenario.com/2013/02/09/the-importance-of-excel/" target="_blank">a commentator</a>
noted about weaknesses of reliance on Excel, <em>“There is no way to trace
where your data come from, there’s no audit trail (so you can overtype numbers
and not know it), and there’s no easy way to test spreadsheets.”</em> This statement
provides a decent outline of software requirements for a minimally reliable data
system. We should be able to trace where the data that generate our results came
from. We should have a record of changes that are made to a file, so we can
diagnose if errors are introduced accidentally. (In addition, we need systems in
which it’s not so easy to accidentally make changes, such as by distinguishing
between viewing and editing; you ought to be able to view a record without
worrying that accidentally touching your keyboard will overwrite your data.) And
we should have systems in which it’s easy to validate and find out if something
has gone wrong.</p>
<p>In the past, we’ve used Excel sometimes to create or input data (e.g., for
tracking participants) that is then imported to stats packages. For now, my very
strong preference is to do any such work in REDCap since the potential
for introduced errors is so high in Excel. Finally, some of the data tools we use
(REDCap, Qualtrics [in older projects], LAVA Query)
export csv and xls files–our general practice is to save them somewhere on the
R: drive and avoid ever touching or rewriting to them directly, only importing
from saved files into a proper stats package.</p>
<p><strong>Google Docs.</strong> In general, we have found that Google Docs is useful for
sharing short-term projects, such as an abstract or IRB submission that needs to
be edited by multiple people before submission. However, it has proven to be
unwieldy for archiving/storage/documentation–we’ve noted problems with
moving/deleting files, with governing permissions and file access, and in
general with organization. So anything that we might want to refer back to in a
matter of months or years should be appropriately organized in GitHub or the R:
drive.</p>
