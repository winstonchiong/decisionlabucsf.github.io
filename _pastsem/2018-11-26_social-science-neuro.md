Today we hosted an interdisciplinary conversation led by [Dan Dohan](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/dan.dohan){:target="\_blank"}, 
a sociologist of medicine, and [Kate Rankin](https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/katherine-rankin-phd){:target="\_blank"}, 
a neuropsychologist and researcher of socioemotional function in the brain. We considered links as well as gaps between 
the traditional social sciences (such as sociology, anthropology, political science and economics) and the growing 
field of *social neuroscience*, examining different discipinary perspectives on a recent review in social neuroscience, 
["The Emerging Social Neuroscience of Justice Motivation"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865787){:target="\_blank"} 
by Jean Decety and Keith J. Yoder. 


Dan observed that social scientists and social neuroscientists, despite their shared interest in social phenomena, are largely 
interested in two very different aspects: social neuroscience being concerned primarily with workings “inside the head" and 
the social sciences being concerned primarily with interactions among people.  Furthermore, some of the lines of 
evidence considered in the paper (such as behaviors of macaques and cleaner fish, or the expectations of infants) may have 
mechanistic relevance for describing the evolutionary or developmental origins of prosocial motivation, but are not 
straightforwardly applicable to political or cultural understandings of justice. We also considered the worry that different 
terms may be used for different referents in different contexts, as well as more general transdisciplinary tensions over 
issues like funding and recognition. In addition, in reviewing the history of other domains in which cognitive neuroscience has been applied to examine  
behaviors originally addressed in other fields (e.g., neuroeconomics, the neurobiology of language, and the neuroscience of 
moral reasoning), we noted that cognitive neuroscience often builds and borrows older disciplines without radically changing 
the explanatory frameworks built by those disciplines themselves.
