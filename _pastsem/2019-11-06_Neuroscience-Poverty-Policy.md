[Emily Murphy](https://www.uchastings.edu/people/emily-murphy/){:target="\_blank"} 
led a works-in-progress investigating how neuroscience can reframe 
approaches to poverty policy. She began with the claim that
current policy/poverty mechanisms embody political assumptions 
about who is deserving of certain benefits and who is not. 
For example, bureaucratic disentitlement can often involve multiple steps and may be  
intentionally complicated to filter applicants based on 
those who are most motivated to go through the trouble to apply and are then presumed to  
be most deserving of the benefits. However, making deliberately inconvenient policies 
as a distributive mechanism 
ignores scientific evidence suggesting that poverty can 
itself undermine brain health and cognition. Thus, policies that impose high 
cognitive and effort demands as part of their design may be regarded as discriminatory.

Our discussion considered the role of scientific evidence in policy depates. 
We also considered potential implications of reframing poverty policy in terms 
of brain science. Could, e.g., such work promote a sort of determinism to 
socioeconomic status; that poor people are somehow pre-determined to remain poor? 
Or might research supporting the claim that poverty causes cognitive deficits 
be interpreted to mean that economic disadvantage is a form of cognitive 
disability? Such arguments could have broader implications beyond neuroscience 
and poverty policy, then involving quesions realted to stigmatization and 
the appropriation of claims made regarding the rights of disabled people.
