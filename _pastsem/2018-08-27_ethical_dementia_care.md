We held a works-in-progress seminar for a draft manuscript of a position paper for the American Academy of 
Neurology on ethical considerations in dementia care, drafted by [Winston Chiong](/team/index.html#Winston Chiong).
We began by considering opportunities and challenges in presenting ethical arguments, not from one's own 
point of view, but instead on behalf of a large organization. 

We were fortunate to have input from members of diverse disciplines, including law, nursing, and social work. 
Points of focus for improving the manuscript included: clarifying the state of research on psychological outcomes 
of biomarker disclosure, reconciling traditional views about the role of genetic counseling with the popularity 
of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and demystifying the roles of palliative care and Adult Protective Services. 
Two recurring themes in dementia ethics that also came up in this discussion were the centrality of capacity 
assessment and the challenge of balancing patient safety and respect for autonomy, for instance, in the context 
of reporting dementia diagnosis to the DMV.
