Sarah Dulaney and Jennifer Merrilees led another seminar on ethical concerns in the care and management of people with Capgras.
Capgras syndrome is common, though not exclusive, to patients with Lewy Body Dementia and can lead one to believe that loved 
ones have been replaced by imposters, or render one unable to recognize oneself, his or her surroundings, pets, plants, etc. 
Drawing from conclusions in Meeri Kim’s [article]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/this-strange-syndrome-causes-people-to-think-their-loved-ones-have-been-replaced-by-identical-impostors/2018/04/06/0091f168-1be6-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html) {:target="_blank"} 
(The Washington Post, 2018) and Thaipisutikul et al.’s [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4004517/pdf/nihms-574645.pdf)  {:target="_blank"} (International Psychogeriatrics, 2013), 
ethical concerns present in cases of Capgras acknowledge the effects of caregiver burden and the high rates of visual 
hallucinations and symptoms of anxiety in patients, which can lead to experiences of guilt or conflicts in value systems for 
behaving in certain ways as a result of not remembering loved ones. 

As Capgras is associated with regions of the brain involved in visual processing and emotional response, we discussed 
potential coping mechanisms like triggering remembering through non-visual sensations, using phone calls to trigger voice 
recognition, and having a friend or family member call the patient to help reduce any anxiety associated with not being able
to visually recognize others. We also spent some time analyzing three case studies of patients with Capgras where we 
identified considerations of care based on the bioethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. These 
were maintaining the patients’ best interests in relation to patient and caregiver safety and convenience, navigating 
between quantity versus quality of life when considering treatment options, and acknowledging the potential financial burden 
of adequate care.
